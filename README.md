# Perform-NMDS-analysis-and-visualization-using-Vegan
This R script performs Non-metric Multidimensional Scaling (NMDS) using the vegan package to visualize community composition patterns based on species abundance data. It calculates Bray–Curtis dissimilarities, fits environmental vectors, and plots samples in reduced-dimensional space for ecological interpretation.
